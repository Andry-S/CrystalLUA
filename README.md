CrystalLUA is a high-level library for binding your native Delphi code and scripts in Lua language. The difference between CrystalLUA and other binding libraries is in high code performance and convenient registration based on RTTI. In addition, CrystalLUA has recently been developed on the basis of [RLua](https://gitlab.com/d-mozulyov/rlua), so this library is cross-platform and does not depend on any dynamic libraries.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
At the moment, the library is being actively developed. However, you can download outdated versions of CrystalLUA: [ANSI (Delphi 6-2007)](https://github.com/d-mozulyov/CrystalLUA/archive/0.1.zip) and [unfinished Unicode](https://github.com/d-mozulyov/CrystalLUA/archive/0.2.zip) versions.
